\subsection{Summary on Java Beans}
\begin{frame}{Java Bean Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A Java Bean is simple plain old java (as in: needs not implement or
    extend anything) with some conventions.
  \item Non args ctor.
  \item Setters and getters name \textit{name} the properties.
  \item PropertyChangeListeners can be informed. (Name, oldvalue, new
    value)
  \item Changes can be vetoed.
  \item GUI (Swing, AWT) components are Java Beans.
  \item Auxiliary file (also using a name pattern) provides BeanInfo
    and a GUI based editor for the properties.
